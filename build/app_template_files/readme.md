# Baseline App Template Files

These files are the foundation for creating the app templates.  On their own, they do nothing.  If you want to create and utilize the app templates, `cd` to the parent folder and run `ant all`, then look for `NativeAppTemplate` and `HybridAppTemplate` in the `artifacts` folder.  These can be used to generate apps from the templates.
