## Upgrade steps from v. 6.1.x to v. 6.2 for native/hybrid/React Native apps

- To upgrade native apps, we strongly recommend creating a new app from the app templates in [the forceios npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/forceios), then migrating the artifacts specific to your app into the new template.
- To upgrade hybrid apps, we strongly recommend creating a new app from the app templates in [the forcehybrid npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/forcehybrid), then migrating the artifacts specific to your app into the new template.
- To upgrade React Native apps, we strongly recommend creating a new app from the app templates in [the forcereact npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/forcereact), then migrating the artifacts specific to your app into the new template.

See the [Mobile SDK Development Guide](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Shared/blob/master/doc/mobile_sdk.pdf?raw=true) for more information about developing hybrid apps with the Mobile SDK and Cordova.
