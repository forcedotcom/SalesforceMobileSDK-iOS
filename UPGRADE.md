## Upgrade steps from v. 3.3.x to v. 4.0 for native/hybrid apps

To upgrade native and hybrid, we strongly recommend creating a new app from the app templates in [the forceios npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/forceios), then migrating the artifacts specific to your app into the new template. The other recommended approach would be to upgrade using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS). Read on if you prefer to update the Mobile SDK artifacts in your existing hybrid app.

### Hybrid 3.3.x to 4.0 upgrade

Upgrading your hybrid app from 3.3.x to 4.0 should be a simple matter of upgrading the Salesforce Cordova plugins themselves. This can be done by using the Cordova command-line tool to remove, then re-add the plugin:

        $ cd MyCordovaAppDir
        $ cordova plugin rm com.salesforce
        $ cordova plugin add https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-CordovaPlugin
        $ cordova prepare

See the [Mobile SDK Development Guide](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Shared/blob/master/doc/mobile_sdk.pdf?raw=true) for more information about developing hybrid apps with the 4.0 SDK and Cordova 3.9.2.
