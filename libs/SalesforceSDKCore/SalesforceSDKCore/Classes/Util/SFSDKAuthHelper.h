 Parameters here include support for an optional overriding Salesforce Identity UI Bridge API front door bridge
 URL with an optional overriding code verifier.  These override the default login URL to load and the default
 code verifier that would be generated for it when web server authentication is enabled.  One use case for this
 is automatic login from a front door bridge URL provided as part of a QR code log in set up.
 
 @param scene Scene that login is initiated for.
 @param completionBlock Block that executes immediately if the user is already logged in or if the app
 config's `shouldAuthenticate` is set to false. Otherwise, this block executes after the user logs in successfully
 if login is required.
 @param frontDoorBridgeUrl Optionally, a Salesforce Identity API front door bridge URL to use in place
 of the default log in URL
 @param codeVerifier Optionally and only with the front door bridge URL parameter, a code verifier to use
 when the front door bridge URL is using web server authentication
