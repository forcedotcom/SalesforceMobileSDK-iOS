 If a custom request body is required for a particular action type, this property can be set to an

 @discussion
 This property can be used in circumstances where URL Form-Encoded or Multipart request bodies can't be used,
 for example when posting a direct JSON payload to a server.  This property is a block that returns an
 `NSInputStream`, rather than an input stream itself, because an input stream cannot be re-used, which will
 cause problems when replaying a request after refreshing authentication credentials.
 
 Use of this feature will automatically disable the setting of HTTP Content-Type and Content-Length headers,
 so it's the responsibility of the user of this property to update those headers accordingly.
