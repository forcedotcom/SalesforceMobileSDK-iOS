/**
 Object that represents an individual element within a multipart stream, used for the request body of a network action.
 
 @discussion
 This object is intended to remain private, and is not meant for public consumption.  This is internally referenced by the
 CSFMultipartInputStream class as a way to break up individual elements of a request body into discrete components, and to
 abstract out the serialization of large requests into streamable segments.
 
 This class attempts to autodetect the object type, and will transform it into the desired output format.  All input elements
 must be decomposable into NSData objects, and any object that's unable to do so will be rejected.  Currently the list of
 object types that can be transformed are:
 
   - NSData (no change)
   - NSString (transformed to UTF8)
   - NSDate (transformed to an ISO8601 date, encoded as UTF8)
   - NSURL (transformed to an UTF8 absolute URL)
