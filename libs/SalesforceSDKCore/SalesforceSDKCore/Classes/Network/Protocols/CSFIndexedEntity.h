/** The `CSFIndexedEntity` protocol indicates that an instance of `CSFOutput`
 has an indexable property bound to it that is capable of being used to uniquely identify
 an instance of the response.  This allows for these objects to be cached and later
 retrieved using the property.

 The value for the index may be any value, though its use should be restricted to values that
 are easily indexed by Core Data, or at least that support NSCoding.
